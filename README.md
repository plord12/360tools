# 360tools

Tools to help publish 360 JPEG photos

## Introduction

Publishing 360 degree JPEG photos ( otherwise known as Photo Spheres ) can be tricky -

* A simple upload to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) (web or app) via the Contributions feature [replaces the image location with the location of the Place](https://support.google.com/maps/thread/205885261?hl=en)
* [Google Street View app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/?id=com.google.android.street&gl=US) has been deprecated
* [Google Street View Studio](https://streetviewstudio.maps.google.com/) only works with mp4s, even then takes a long time to process
* [OpenStreetMap's umap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/) works well, but can be tricky to configure 360 images

360tools is a command-line tool to process and upload 360 degree photos generated by 360 degree cameras.

## Features

* Invoke [Googles Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) to display points of interest near photo locations
* Prepare and upload photos to Google Maps
  * Use [Googles Oauth2 API](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) to authenticate uploads
  * Extracts location, time and altitude data from photos
  * Use [Googles StreetViewPublish API](https://developers.google.com/streetview/publish/reference/rest) to upload the photos
  * Generates photo metadata
  * Generates photo connections - the first photo links to the second, second to the third etc
  * Generates photo heading - each photo is pointed at the location of the next
  * Use [Googles StreetViewPublish API](https://developers.google.com/streetview/publish/reference/rest) to upload the metadata
* TODO: Make use of a GPX track to obtain missing location information
* TODO: Generate umap configurations

## Google credentials

Before interacting with Google, you will need to create an **API key** and an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** from the [Google Cloud Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).

* Create a **API Key** and restrict the key to only access the **Places API**.  Save the key in file **apikey.dat**.
* Create a **Client ID** for **Web Application** and add **http://127.0.0.1** to the **Authorized redirect URIs**.  Save the Client ID in file **clientid.dat** and the Client secret in **clientsecret.dat**.

## Uploading photos to Google Maps

Run the tool with the list of JPG photos to upload -

```

2023/03/23 12:44:39 Authorize this app at: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=...
```

At this point a browser window should appear promting you to authenticate to your Google account.
Once done, the tool will continue.

These photos should appear on Google Maps ( when **Street View** detail is enabled ) as blue dots.  Arrows should be be available to navigate from one photo to the next.
Note that it can take a bit of time to appear.

However the photos will not be associated with any Google Place.

## Uploading photos to Google Maps and add to a Google Place

First run the tool to get a list of nearby places -

```
360tools-darwin --pois *.JPG
2023/03/23 14:48:27 ChIJ34aXR8ODdkgRSPYmPPFK6RM: PJM Roofing
2023/03/23 14:48:27 ChIJB2vKz_mDdkgRIKm50jzhTGk: Old Forest Meadows
2023/03/23 14:48:27 ChIJR-N9NBODdkgRDV3BgOGyCMU: Oven Doctor - Oven Cleaning Wokingham
...
```

Then pass the Place ID to the upload -

```
360tools-darwin --placeid ChIJB2vKz_mDdkgRIKm50jzhTGk *.JPG
...
```

The photos should now be assoicated with a Google Place.

## Testing

This tool has only been lightly testing on my Mac ... whilst I can build binaries for other platforms, I don't have an easy way to test these.

## Beer

Whilst this tool is open source, if you like it please consider buying me a beer :-)
